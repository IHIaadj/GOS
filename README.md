# GOS: Grassroot Operator Search
Grassroot Operator Search (GOS) is a PyTorch project that aims to find the optimal operator replacement for the least efficient layer in a deep learning architecture. By performing an operator search at the grassroots level, GOS seeks to enhance the overall efficiency and performance of deep learning models.

## Overview

Deep learning models often consist of multiple layers, each performing different operations such as convolution, pooling, or fully connected layers. However, some layers may be less efficient in terms of computation or memory usage, leading to suboptimal performance. GOS addresses this issue by focusing on identifying and replacing the least efficient layer with an alternative operator that improves efficiency without sacrificing accuracy.

GOS utilizes a search algorithm to explore various operator replacements and evaluates their impact on model performance and efficiency metrics. The project provides a flexible framework to conduct operator search experiments on different deep learning architectures and datasets.
